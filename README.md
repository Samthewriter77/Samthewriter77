- 👋 Hi, I’m @Samthewriter77
- 👀 I’m interested in Rust, python data science, making fun games in javascript, and tracking my creative writing in fun ways
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and using apis, noSQL, text to python methods to personalize my writing data
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - not much, still learning for now.
- 📫 How to reach me - message me here.

Projects I'm working on right now:
  - ethereum price checking morning text (python, api request, sms integration / imessage integration) & telling me if there is a new manga of One Piece out (webscrapping)
  - dolewhip counter - swift/javascript webapp to count and have a pretty interface for an upcoming disney trip
  - python based progress bar application using writing goals stored in GoogleSheets
  - python data based information on hot pepper seed growth / hops
  - Solitdle (working title) - a wordle clone that uses card suits and numbers and has you complete the hand using clues

Way in the future projects:
 -  2D scroller/fighter written primarily in Rust
 -  Rust based anything
 -  Anki clones or add-ins written in Rust (as practice, not for wider distribution)
 -  Personal library tracker
 -  german learning "phrasebook" with a random phrase w/translation and then cataloguing those phrases
 -  morning update text but includes a fun bird fact sheet from Audobon.com (working on how to randomize the pull but track previously sent ones)
